## 🌍 Project Context

In regional healthcare networks like **Bicol**, hospitals often struggle with inefficient, fragmented blood management systems. UNITE addresses these challenges by providing:

- Centralized visibility over blood supply  
- Reduced wastage of expired blood units  
- Faster inter-hospital response during emergencies  
- Data-driven reporting for compliance and policy-making  

This initiative supports the **Department of Health’s (DOH)** digital transformation goals and enhances collaboration among hospitals, LGUs, NGOs, and the donor community.
